	Afang soup; a delight to behold and to eat. It is a special delicacy of the <strong><em>Efik</em></strong> and <strong><em>ibibio</em></strong> tribes of Nigeria. Some parts of <strong><em>Cameroon</em></strong> bordering that part of Nigeria also enjoy this delicacy.

	Nigerian Afang Soup
	Afang Soup is soup is a soup rich in meats and vegetables and palm oil. 
	If you are averse to palm oil then this soup may not be for you. 
	Some people actually make this oil free but Noooo I can't make this soup oil free lol. 
	The oil is the real deal in this recipe. I am sure the originators of this dish will agree with me ?. 
	Oil compliments most vegetable soups like Afang and Edikang ikong. Having tasted Afang with oil. 
	I doubt you can convince me to ditch the oil in this recipe.
